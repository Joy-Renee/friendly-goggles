                        <p>While Coffee was introduced in Kenya in 1893, the first crop of Gibson's coffee was planted in the early 1960s by our father (Gibson) after Kenya attained self governance from the British Government.</p>
                        <p>On a small farm of five acres, our father planted the first Arabica coffee tree variety SL34/SL28 in that virgin land and produced the best quality coffee the world has ever tasted. Now 50 years later, we produce the same quality coffee in hundreds of acres. Our firms are situated on the slopes of Mt. Kenya just a few meters from the equator line.</p>
                        <p>The rich volcanic soil coupled with the excellent climatic conditions gives our coffee the high needed nutrients. Gibson’s coffee is handpicked, sorted and processed through wet processing and sun dried. This well monitored and controlled process ensures that the resulting cup is extra ordinarily rich in acidity and flavor, deep in aroma, full bodied and leaves one’s mouth full of flora notes. After processing our coffee at the farm level, the parchment beans are sent to a milling factory where the husk is removed and the resulting green bean is mechanically graded into 7 grades according to size, shape and weight.
